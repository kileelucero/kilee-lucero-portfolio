//had a lot of fun creating my first webpage
//very frustrating at times but took plenty of breaks to keep sane and thoughts just started pouring in when I took as step back.
//was having a hard time trying to pseudo-code but whenever I took a break, my mind would kind of whiteboard the pathway for me to code what I needed.
//was satisfying being able to debug my own mishaps and was a victim of overthinking how I needed to code it.
//My jumbotron's broke differently on each html page and the more I played around with different sizes, columns, rows, etc I was able to diagnose where I was making errors.
//all in all had a great time creating this personalized web page and being a part of study groups to bounce ideas off of others.
//need to work on pseudo-coding and git pushing more frequently.
